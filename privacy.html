<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> Feburary 24, 2026</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how Noka (“Noka”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Noka mobile application and related services (the “Service”).
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account information:</strong> your email address used for authentication (e.g., one-time passcodes).</li>
  <li><strong>User content you provide:</strong> space names, item names, notes, and images you upload to the Service.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage & diagnostics:</strong> app interactions, device/app version, and crash/diagnostic data to maintain reliability and performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>We use information to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Service</li>
  <li>Enable search and organization features</li>
  <li>Process images for AI-assisted functionality (see Section 3)</li>
  <li>Sync your data across devices (when applicable)</li>
  <li>Provide customer support</li>
  <li>Improve product quality, performance, and security</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. AI Image Processing</h2>
<p>
If you upload images, we may process them using automated systems to detect and identify objects and improve search functionality.
Images are used solely to provide features in the Service.
</p>
<p>
We do not sell your images or use them for advertising.
</p>

<h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>
We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited information with trusted service providers that help us operate the Service, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authentication and account services</li>
  <li>Cloud hosting and storage</li>
  <li>Analytics and crash reporting (for reliability)</li>
</ul>
<p>
These providers may only use information as needed to provide services to us and are expected to protect it.
</p>

<h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
<p>
Paid features may be offered through Apple In-App Purchases. Apple processes payments and manages billing.
We do not receive or store your full payment card details.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
We retain information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service. We may retain certain information longer if required by law or for legitimate business purposes (such as security and fraud prevention).
</p>

<h2>7. Account Deletion</h2>
<p>
You can delete your account at any time directly within the Noka app using the <strong>“Delete Account”</strong> feature.
When you delete your account, your account information and associated user content will be deleted within a reasonable timeframe, subject to legal requirements.
</p>

Noka is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
</p>

<h2>9. International Users</h2>
<p>
If you access the Service from outside the United States, you understand that your information may be processed in the United States or other locations where our service providers operate.
</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
